# sfw-helper
Chrome extension to make web content SFW


## Motivation 
(1) Sanitation of webcontent as protection against innappropriate images through the replacement by a harmless image. For use in public administrative, professional, and parental environments.
(2) User-chosen censorship of multimedia as protection against trigger-sensitive content. 

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install my-crazy-module --save
```

Windows:

```sh
edit autoexec.bat
```

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
